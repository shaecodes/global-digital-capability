# 🌐 Global Digital Capability Dashboard

This dashboard provides a comprehensive visualization of global disparities and strengths in digital capability, drawing on data from the **Global Data Barometer 2025**. It highlights how countries perform across key indicators such as **Data Infrastructure**, **Digital Government**, **Governance Foundation**, and **Internet Access**, enabling evidence-based discussions around digital inclusion, institutional capacity, and the enabling environment for data use.

## 📊 Purpose

The dashboard was built to:

* Visually explore and compare digital readiness and infrastructure across regions.
* Highlight disparities in internet access and digital government maturity.
* Provide insights to policymakers, researchers, and the public about where strategic investment is needed to close digital capability gaps.

## 📁 Data Source

The dataset is sourced from the **Global Data Barometer 2025**, which evaluates a range of **critical competencies** necessary for effective public data systems. These include:

* **Data Infrastructure**: Foundational technologies and systems for managing and distributing data.
* **Digital Government**: Institutional maturity for providing digital services and governance online.
* **Governance Foundation**: Legal, policy, and institutional structures that support ethical and effective data use.
* **Internet Access**: Measured through indicators like broadband affordability and population-level access.

These indicators are measured across countries and continents, revealing substantial **regional disparities** in capability and access. For example:

* Countries like **Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay** show strong institutional and infrastructure maturity.
* In contrast, **Liberia, Cameroon, and Gambia** score very low, underscoring critical gaps in both digital infrastructure and institutional readiness.

## 📌 Key Features

### 1. **KPI Summary**

Quick view of the number of countries, average scores, and filtered results based on continent selection.

### 2. **Interactive Global Maps**

* **Overall Digital Capability Map**: Shows country-level performance using a composite score.
* **Internet Access Map**: Visualizes disparities in internet accessibility across countries.

### 3. **Performance Highlights**

* Top-performing and lowest-performing countries on key metrics such as overall score, data infrastructure, and digital government.

### 4. **Score Table**

A sortable table showing each country’s scores in:

* Data Infrastructure
* Digital Government
* Governance Foundation

### 5. **Charts and Graphs**

* **Bar Chart of Average Overall Score by Country**
* **Stacked Bar Chart** of three major pillars (infrastructure, governance, digital services)
* **Scatter Plot** of Digital Government vs Data Infrastructure
* **Internet Access Scatter vs Infrastructure**
* **Average Internet Access Score by Continent**

## 🌍 Insights

From the analysis:

* **South America** generally outperforms **Africa** in all digital capability categories.
* **Uruguay** and **Brazil** lead in digital government and infrastructure.
* **Uganda** shows high digital government scoring but lags behind in governance structures.
* **Africa** shows significant within-region variation, with countries like **South Africa** performing far better than regional peers.

These findings reinforce the Barometer's conclusion that while **technology access (like internet)** is critical, **institutional readiness** and **governance maturity** play an equally important role in digital capability.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Pandas** for data manipulation.
* **Power BI Desktop** (for supplementary dashboard prototyping and exploration).
